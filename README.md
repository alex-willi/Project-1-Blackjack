Classic casino card game Blackjack

Blackjack probably originated in the French casinos around 1700.

In the 20th century, the precursor of the blackjack was still called 21 in Nevada.

But it was during this time the card game 21 has changed its name to Blackjack. Gambling halls and casinos needed a way to promote the game. They offered bonus payouts, including one that paid extra if a black jack (a jack of spades or clubs) was dealt along with an ace of spades. As the game became more popular, the bonus payouts became less common but the informal name was already stuck.
