Player will see a black jack table.

The player will place a bet.

Once a bet is placed cards will be dealt to the player and computer.

The player will see buttons to stay hit or split.

If a player hits they will be dealt another card, they can repeat this until they press stay or they bust.

If a player choses split on double there face down card is turned over and they are dealt 2 cards face up.

When the player's turn is done the computer will decide to stay or hit.

If the computer hits it will do so until its total card value is equal to or greater than 17.
